# NeumorphicCustomButtonCard
Neumorphism (or Neo-skeuomorphism) is a modern iteration of a style of designing web elements, frames, screens, etc. So, why not using it on Home Assistant Lovelace Cards? Let's do it.

## Before start

What do I need?

- [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) using [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) and installed:
  - [Card-mod](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod) - to create our fancy card buttons on lovelace dashboard
  - [Custom Button Card](https://github.com/custom-cards/button-card) - to style our card buttons on lovelace dashboard
